<p>Peer-to-Peer Everything . . . Open design spec for an integrated p2p application suite.</p>

<p>Greets, p2p peeps!</p>

<p>PeerPoint is an evolving crowdsourced design specification for a suite of integrated peer-to-peer applications to include (but not limited to) social networking, real-time project collaboration, content management, database management, voting, trust/reputation metrics, complementary currency, crowd funding, etc. This specification overlaps with many existing p2p infrastructure and social networking projects but also goes substantially beyond anything yet existing.</p>

<p>Members of other projects are encouraged to participate in further developing the open PeerPoint specs and to adopt any part of the specs that they can use.</p>
