Semantics
=========
These taxonomies become semantic web ontologies when they are defined in machine-readable protocols such as:
* Extensible Markup Language (XML)
* JSON or JavaScript Object Notation, is “a text-based open standard designed for human-readable data interchange. It is derived from the JavaScript scripting language for representing simple data structures and associative arrays, called objects. Despite its relationship to JavaScript, it is language-independent, with parsers available for many languages. The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, serving as an alternative to XML.” (Wikipedia)
* Resource Description Framework (RDF)
* Web Ontology Language (OWL)
* Attention Profiling Mark-up Language (APML) is an XML-based format for expressing a person's interests and dislikes. APML allows users to share their own personal Attention Profile in much the same way that OPML allows the exchange of reading lists between News Readers. The idea is to compress all forms of Attention Data into a portable file format containing a description of ranked user interests. More »
* Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
* Description of a Project (DOAP) (an RDF schema and XML vocabulary to describe software project)
* Service Provisioning Markup Language (SPML) is an XML-based framework, being developed by OASIS, for exchanging user, resource and service provisioning information between cooperating organizations
* Friend of a friend (FOAF) a machine-readable ontology describing persons, their activities and their relations to other people and objects.
* "WebID" redirects here. It is not to be confused with WeBid, the online auction software.
* The WebID Protocol (formerly known as FOAF+SSL) is “a decentralized secure authentication protocol utilizing FOAF profile information as well as the SSL security layer available in virtually all modern web browsers. Contrary to the usual SSL utilization patterns, it does not require the dedicated Certificate authority to perform the user authorization. Useful identities can be minted for users easily by authorities, but a FOAF-based web of trust connecting all the user's activity on the World Wide Web can then be established gradually, without formal key signing parties, to make the identity more trustworthy and hard for anyone (even the original issuing authority) to forge.”
