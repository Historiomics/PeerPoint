PeerPoint
=========

Peer-to-Peer Everything . . . Open design spec for an integrated p2p application suite.

PeerPoint is an evolving crowdsourced design specification for a suite of integrated peer-to-peer applications to include (but not limited to) social networking, real-time project collaboration, content management, database management, voting, trust/reputation metrics, complementary currency, crowd funding, etc. This specification overlaps with many existing p2p infrastructure and social networking projects but also goes well beyond anything yet existing.

The project does not aim to develop working software directly, but to crowdsource a comprehensive definition of what PeerPoint might represent for many different types of designers, hackers, software engineers, and user communities. 

Members of other p2p projects are encouraged to participate in further developing the open PeerPoint specs and to adopt any part of the specs that they can use in their own work.

This is an open source and collaborative project that aims to create a formal (and open!) PeerPoint Design Definition. This is a crucial step towards developing all other aspects of a fully open, integrated, all-inclusive, p2p application suite. As far as we can determine, no such suite exits or is even on the drawing board.

We want to develop this missing design definition through inclusive and collaborative methods rooted in public discussion, workshopping and sharing different understandings of this field to ensure such a definition will 1) adequately cover all the different meanings and applications of p2p application design and 2) meet all the needs of the user communities.

This type of collaborative design is a component of the Open Knowledge, Open Design, and Free/Libre/Open Software movements.

You can read more about the project here. Please feel free to browse the details about becoming a member here and introduce yourself on our discussion list so we can get you involved. The archives of the discussion con be found here.

other.definitions folder

Here you can find some existing Open Definitions (formatted as Markdown) so Github will give a formatted preview directly. We can start by commenting the existing definitions by opening issues, in order to understand what can be taken from them and what can be improved or added.

peerpoint.design_definition folder

The Open Design Definition will be developed and accessed here. Nothing here at the moment... we need your collaboration! :)

meta folder

This is where you can learn how this collaborative process works: at the same time, it is open source, so you can access it, comment it with issues, discuss on the mailing list, modify it when necessary and so on. Three components define the process: the storyboard (that explains the story as a comic in an easy way), the participation matrix (that explains the whole process and how participation is structured), the activity design (that explains the whole activity in more detail, including tools, rules, connections, and so on). You can find them in the meta folder with more information about understanding them and editing them. As an example, here's the plan for the whole process (the participation matrix:
