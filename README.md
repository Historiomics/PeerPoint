PeerPoint
=========

Peer-to-Peer Everything . . . Open design spec for an integrated p2p application suite.

Greets, p2p peeps!

PeerPoint is an evolving crowdsourced design specification for a suite of integrated peer-to-peer applications to include (but not limited to) social networking, real-time project collaboration, content management, database management, voting, trust/reputation metrics, complementary currency, crowd funding, etc. This specification overlaps with many existing p2p infrastructure and social networking projects but also goes substantially beyond anything yet existing.

Members of other projects are encouraged to participate in further developing the open PeerPoint specs and to adopt any part of the specs that they can use.
