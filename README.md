PeerPoint
=========

Peer-to-Peer Everything . . . Open design spec for an integrated p2p application suite.

PeerPoint is an evolving crowdsourced design specification for a suite of integrated peer-to-peer applications to include (but not limited to) social networking, real-time project collaboration, content management, database management, voting, trust/reputation metrics, complementary currency, crowd funding, etc. This specification overlaps with many existing p2p infrastructure and social networking projects but also goes substantially beyond anything yet existing.

The project does not aim to develop working software directly, but to crowdsourse a comprehensive definition of what PeerPoint might represent for many different types of designers, programmers, hackers, software engineers, systems analysts, and user communities. 

Members of other p2p projects are encouraged to participate in further developing the open PeerPoint specs and to adopt any part of the specs that they can use.

This is an open source and collaborative project that aims to create a formal (and open!) PeerPoint Design Definition. This is a crucial step towards developing all other aspects of a fully integrated and open, all-inclusive, p2p application suite. As far as we have been able to ascertain, No such suite exits or is even on the drawing board.

We want to develop this missing design definition through inclusive and collaborative methods rooted in public discussion, workshopping and sharing different understandings of this field to ensure such a definition will adequately cover all the different meanings and applications of p2p application design.

This type of collaborative design is a component of the Open Knowledge, Open Design, and Open Software movements.
