PeerPoint
=========

Peer-to-Peer Everything . . . Open design spec for an integrated p2p application suite.

PeerPoint is an evolving crowdsourced design specification for a suite of integrated peer-to-peer applications to include (but not limited to) social networking, real-time project collaboration, content management, database management, voting, trust/reputation metrics, complementary currency, crowd funding, etc. This specification overlaps with many existing p2p infrastructure and social networking projects but also goes well beyond anything yet existing.
